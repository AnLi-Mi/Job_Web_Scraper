# Job_Web_Scraper

The program scrapes my faviourite websites with job offers and then lists only the ones that suite my requirements. During my job hunt I spend every morning visiting my favourite sites and repeatedly trying different combinations of filters. Automised process not only saves me a lot of time but also let me learn and practise unit testing and desingning object orientated programs.

<h3> Functionality:</h3>

It's enough to run the program and it scans all the sites and generate a list of neatly preserted job offers that suites my previously determined expectations. It doesn't require any inputs or visiting sites. 

The most timeconsuming part used to be searching internships as most of the sites don't have a seperate filter for them so I needed to scan  all junior jobs titles to find -internship-related key words. Also for short-term jobs I don't mind relocating to different city/country but for permanat ones I prefer to stay in my city or work remotly. 

I've started the project using procedural programming but after realising that some of the functions are the same for all sites and some must be adjust to the structure of specific site, I decided to intrduce also an object orientated solution.
